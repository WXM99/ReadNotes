# CH15 Approximation Algorithm (ALS)

Approximate to Optimization with a Performance Boundary.

Ensuring AA solution close to an OPT solution to a instance of problem

- AA is faster than OPT;
- AA is often insighted enlightened by Greedy
- The closer an AA to an OPT, the harder to prove it's correctness
